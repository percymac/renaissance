      <p>Renaissance golf club is a social golf club for amateur golf enthusiasts around Gauteng. Before it was launched as an official club, 
        a few of the founding members used to regularly play a round of golf, every Sunday without fail, a tradition still in full effect at the club, at one of the 
        many golf courses in Gauteng province. As beginner golfers, we particularly loved to play these courses (NB: the list is not exhaustive but we particularly
        played these extensively), 
        <ul><li>Leeuwkop Golf Course,</li><li>Services Golf Club,</li><li>Crown Mines Golf Club, and</li><li>Waterkloof Country Club</li></ul>. 
        After a while a decision was made to make our Sunday game official and a part of a fully constituted body with memberships. For g those who 
        have been with the club from its genesis, have witnessed its growth from having a membership of about 12 members to its current 48 strong members.
        The typical profile of our membership is mainly middle age, professional or self-employed individuals. Typical age profile is above 40 years to 
        just above 60 years. The one thing binding us all is our love for the game of golf.

      <p>In the above picture is <strong>Ishmael "Soso" Mokhoka</strong>, the RGC 2021 Medal Competion champion. 
        This is a year long competition made of seven individual strokeplay games. The winner is 
        the golfer who scores the lowest gross over the seven games. The formula is not that 
        straight forward but that effectively is what you need to win this competion, score the 
        lowest gross score in most of the seven games. A true test of a golfers' skill level. Soso 
        truly desrves the accolades as he was by far the best performing golfer all season.
